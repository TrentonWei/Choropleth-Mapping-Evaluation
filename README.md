# Algorithm for classification evaluation of choropleth

#The tools were implemented in C# on ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI, USA), each tool has a separate form to set the input, output and parameters for the algorithms.

(1) Classification evaluation see MapAssign.

(2) As for the classification for choropleth，see mapclassify-master，refer to: https://github.com/pysal/mapclassify. Many thanks for their open source code.
